Subdepartment Summaries . Subsystem Summary . PCB | Goals accomplished: School issues, and the work was saved on another person&#39;s computer, so nothing much second day. However, one the first day for pcb+battery we got everyone on the program but we only had one functioning computer in the end. We got the line of vias made and the 2 layers(?) and started brainstorming ideas on how to connect the vias i hope to actually like do things next meeting when I have a computer, and start designing more of PCB | . Board (Flipped) | Today Flipped Board worked on CADing the bottom portion of the board and working with Wiring to confirm a few things. I had to pull out my guided meditations because REV Robotics made all their parts’ CAD models with an 89* tilt so we couldn’t constrain anything 😭. We had to DIY bricks with mounting holes instead of using official parts, which was tedious but ended up working out. This also means Build might need to drill bigger holes on the actual board. We are nearly halfway done with the CAD!🥰✨ | . Board (Regular) | Regular board seemed to create finalized designs for the board and are starting to work with build. | . Wiring and Pneumatics | Today the Wiring and Pneumatics team began planning out the CAN wiring of the board design. We currently have STAR topology planned out and next meeting the goal is to complete DAISY topology and make revision where needed. | . Links/Supplementary/Subsystem Material .

Continued with projects | Waiting for build | Wednesday was a bit more fluid, lots of absences | READ THE ENGINEERING NOTEBOOK STUFF | Please mind your gracious professionalism. | HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROHIN 🎂 | . Subdepartment Summaries . I’d like to note I saw a lot of working ahead, so great job this week! - Alex Z . Subsystem Summary . PCB | Goals accomplished: Introduced the problem we are trying to solve and the proposed solution we are designing for (hoola hoop vs tree), researched and found the screw terminal we will be using for the PCB, devised a plan to use 4 terminals split into 2 linked groups with 2 back to back terminals per group for a total of 32 holes and 16 ports, got a basic introduction to the concept of creating models for parts that don’t have circuitmaker models | . Board (Flipped) | SO flipped board team had a list from last week of all the parts we needed on the board so we measured them and made scaled models. We split into two groups to fill out the top and bottom of the board. Both groups used the same scaling of 1 unit = 1 inch so it was easy to overlap them and see where everything connects. OH and I learned to never draft in pen even if it looks better because there is always going to be something changed and it’s really awkward because you can’t erase pen… I’m glad everyone was productive in the flipped board group; we got a lot of things done!!!!!!!!!!!💕🤭 | . Board (Regular) | Regular board seemed to create finalized designs for the board and are starting to work with build. | .

We started FRC training and you java training is officially complete 🥶🥶🥶 Its okay if you’re behind on the java training slides and exercises, you’ll become familiar with and understand the usage of all the topics we covered in the past 5 weeks through FRC training. This means that you should focus solely on our FRC training curriculum instead of the java training | . | On Wednesday, those who came were able to run the code they wrote on venom &amp; we covered the process for running your code using the FRC driver station and command pallete Slides 87 &amp; 88 | . | FRC training is really tedious as theres a lot that goes into controlling robots. You need to code subsystems, commands, and robot container all before you start the process of testing. If you missed this week, don’t be overwhelmed by the amount of slides, a lot of them have instructions and such, but its VERY IMPORTANT that you are caught up with the content this week. Next week we’re covering more advance topics building off of what we did this week. | . | . Homework . Finish coding the shooter subsystem, creating upper and lower shoot commands, and binding them to button presses THIS HOMEWORK IS MANDATORY If you don’t have this done, you will be marginally behind and it will be much harder to contribute to the team when we split into project groups | If you’re behind on java training, just get started on this and you’ll learn all the java fundamentals along the way | . | . | FRC Code Base Quiz THIS HOMEWORK IS OPTIONAL but is HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE WHO MISSED TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY This will essentially test your understanding of the command-based programming paradigm in FRC | The slides for a lot of the topics on the quiz start after 89 | . | . | .
